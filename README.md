# A Beautiful Mess

This is a little world I'm building for you. It's a game about chasing memories, catching what's lost, and finding our way back to each other through the noise.

## How to Play

*   **Move around:** Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**.
*   **Dash/Boost:** Hold **Shift** if you need to catch up fast.
*   **Pause:** Press **P** or **Esc** if you need a break.

## The Goal

You are the **Runner**. She is the **Spectre**. 

She's a bit shy and will try to swish away if you get too close. To move forward, you have to help her get "caught" near one of the **Gravity Wells** (the dark swirling spots). 

When she's trapped there and you're close enough to reach out, you'll recover a **Memory Fragment**. Use **A/D** to flip through the photos in the memory, and press **Space** when you're ready to move to the next part of the story.

## A Few Tips

*   **Mass & Gravity:** The Spectre doesn't like the gravity wells. If you shoot her, she gets a little "heavier" and it's harder for her to escape the pull.
*   **Bouncing:** Your shots bounce off the walls. Use that to your advantage!
*   **The Wrap:** The world has no edges. If you go off one side, you'll just pop out on the other.
